		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>
					Is the writer free?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Yes, it does not cost anything and won't cost you anything ever if you sign up now.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>
					How can I sign up after adding it to the iOS homescreen?
				</h3>
				<p>
					This is not possible right now. But it is on my roadmap.
