		<h2>
			The first project: Writer
		</h2>

		<p>
			I'll launch Toolset.One Writer as my first project. It serves as collection of texts. It features minimal writing. To do so, there are three simple screens:
		</p>
		<h4>
			1. Sign In
		</h4>
		<p>
			The sign in consists of an input field for your email address. Type it in and you'll get a link to sign in. No picking of a "strong password" and no forgotten passwords. We don't have to deal with storing passwords or leaks of password databases.
		</p>
		<h4>
			2. List
		</h4>
		<p>
			A straightforward list of your texts. Click on one to get to the writing screen of it or use the button with a plus on it to create a new one.
		</p>
		<h4>
			3. Writing
		</h4>
		<p>
			The third screen is optimized to write a text without distractions. Just concentrate on the text to be created. It saves automatically.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the simplest app I was able to come up with. It solves a problem. It's minimal. It's open source. It syncs to all of your devices. Try it. It is free.
		</p>

			Trying to unblock myself

			For well over a year, I had a lot to do. Getting healthier. Move into a new flat. Do some freelancing. Procrastinate. That blocked me from creating stuff. But now, I have spare time again and I'd love to create things. But I forgot how to work on side projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are so many ideas in my head. There is even a lot of code existing. But somehow, I don't know how to end a side project anymore.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's my plan to get rid of this bad habit: I'll launch several open sourced apps over the next weeks. Each will solve just one problem â€“ not for teams but individuals. This keeps complexity to a low level. I will use firebase to reduce complexity further. Let's see where this will go.
